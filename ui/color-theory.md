## ðŸŒˆ 2. The Color Wheel

The **color wheel** is a circle showing color relationships.

### ðŸŽ¯ 3 Main Types:

* **Primary colors**: Red, Blue, Yellow
  â†’ All other colors are made from these.
* **Secondary colors**: Green, Orange, Purple
  â†’ Made by mixing two primary colors.
* **Tertiary colors**: Red-orange, Blue-green, etc.
  â†’ Made by mixing a primary + secondary.

ðŸ‘‰ Here's a basic color wheel:

```
        Red
      /     \
  Purple     Orange
   /           \
Blue           Yellow
      \     /

## ðŸ§  3. Color Harmonies (How to Combine Colors)

These are **formulas** to make your color palette balanced and appealing:

* Calm and cohesive

| Red    | Energy, urgency, danger      | Sale buttons, alerts      |
| Blue   | Trust, calm, professionalism | Finance, tech, healthcare |
| Yellow | Happiness, attention         | Warnings, onboarding      |
| Green  | Growth, success, health      | Success messages, nature  |
| Purple | Luxury, creativity           | Fashion, art              |

## ðŸ’¡ 5. UI/UX Color Best Practices

* **Limit your palette**: 1â€“2 main colors + 2 neutrals + 1 accent.
* **High contrast for readability**: Dark text on light background (or vice versa).
* **Use color to guide actions**: Green = success, Red = error, Blue = clickable.
* **Test accessibility**: Ensure good contrast (use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)).
